NETWORK SECURITY GROUPS:

- A set of acces controller routes wrapped around a VM or subnet
- Inspects incoming traffic to approve or deny packets
- Things to look at: RULE NAME, SOURCE IP, SOURCE PORT, DESTINATION IP, DESTINATION PORT, DIRECTION (inbound, outbound), ACTION (Allowed or denied), PRIORITY(Lower = higher prio)
- Isolating traffic between subnets
- Control traffic from the internet
- 

PRIVATE LINK:

- Virtual network via expressroute, consists of a VM on a subnet. Backend stored on blob storage.
- 1. Private IP of VM gets translated to a public IP for the blob storage. 
- 2. Can pick specific networks available to connect
- 3. Private endpoint, needs a private link resource. Does not need a public endpoint.
- 

VIRTUAL NETWORKS:

- Expressroute allows you to extend your local networks to the Microsoft cloud over a private connection.
Expressroute does not go over the public internet [list of certifications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/regulatory/offering-home?view=o365-worldwide). Annual budget of 1 billion$. Staff of about 3500 people. Only accepts public IP addresses, but can translate private ones using NAT (network adress translation). Bandwidth can be altered without terminating/rebuilding the connection. [List of express route locations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/azure/expressroute/expressroute-locations)
- Add rules, for instance. Deny all except for the desired Azure Storage location.
- All communication happens on the Microsoft backbone network. 

VNET SVERICE ENDPOINTS:

- any connection with storage on same region happens on mcr backbone network.
- connections to public internet still would go through firewall
- higher priority then default route
- Enable for instance Microsoft.storage
- Secure and fast.
- limit transactional data, prevent data theft.
